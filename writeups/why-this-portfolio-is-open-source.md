# Why This Portfolio Is Open Source

This portfolio is not open source to showcase design.

It is open source because the **process** behind it mattered more than the outcome.

## The problem

For years, I treated my portfolio as a side effect of my work.

Something to “get done”, tweak endlessly, or copy from templates that
never quite fit.

The result was always the same:
- overdesigned
- under-explained
- or abandoned entirely

None of those reflected how I actually build software.

## Treating it as an engineering problem

This portfolio exists because I finally approached it the same way I approach systems:

- define constraints
- avoid unnecessary abstraction
- optimize for clarity and longevity
- ship something understandable

Open sourcing it was a natural extension of that mindset.

## Why open source helps

Making this repository public:
- forces architectural discipline
- documents decisions instead of hiding them
- allows others to learn from both structure and trade-offs

If someone else struggled with presenting their work, this repo might help them
avoid the same dead ends.

## What this is not

This is not a template.
Not a starter kit.
Not a UI framework.

It’s a finished artifact, shared intentionally.
