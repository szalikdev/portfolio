# szalik.dev — Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio.

It is intentionally **open source**.

Not because the design is the point —  but because the *process* is.

---

## Why this exists

I’ve been building software since 2012.

For most of that time, I **struggled** with one thing that had nothing to do with
algorithms, systems, or infrastructure:

> presenting my work in a way that felt honest, technical, and not embarrassing.

This portfolio is the result of finally treating presentation as an **engineering
problem**, not a design contest.

If you’ve ever:
- overdesigned your portfolio
- underdesigned your portfolio
- abandoned it halfway through
- copied templates that didn’t feel like you

this repository is for you.

## What this is (and is not)

### This *is*:
- a real-world, production-ready portfolio
- built incrementally, step by step
- focused on clarity, restraint, and credibility
- opinionated by design

### This is *not*:
- a generic portfolio template
- a UI kit
- a theme marketplace product
- a showcase of frontend tricks

---

## Tech stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion** (used sparingly)
- Dark-mode only

Performance, accessibility, and readability were treated as first-class concerns.

---

## Design principles

This project follows a few strict rules:

- Dark mode only
- Gradients as **accent**, not decoration
- Motion only when it adds clarity
- No progress bars, skill percentages, or fluff
- Content > effects

If you plan to fork this, I strongly recommend keeping these constraints.

They exist for a reason.

---

## Can I use this?

Yes.

You are free to:
- fork it
- adapt it
- strip it down
- rebuild it for yourself

**Please do not**:
- impersonate me
- reuse personal content without replacing it
- present this exact portfolio as your own work

If you build something inspired by this, a mention or link back is appreciated,
but not required.
