# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

This repository is primarily a **personal portfolio**, but it is open source
to help others learn from the process.

Contributions are welcome **as long as they respect the intent of the project**.

---

## What makes sense to contribute

- Fixes for bugs or regressions
- Performance improvements
- Accessibility improvements
- Small, well-reasoned refinements
- Documentation improvements

---

## What does NOT make sense

- Large visual redesigns
- Style overhauls
- New color themes
- Feature requests that turn this into a template or framework
- Adding complexity for the sake of flexibility

This is an opinionated project by design.

---

## Guidelines

- Keep changes small and focused
- Explain *why* a change is needed, not just *what* it does
- Avoid adding new dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- Respect the existing design constraints

If you are unsure whether something fits, open an issue first.

---

## Code style

- TypeScript preferred
- Readability over cleverness
- Explicit > implicit
- Minimal abstractions

---

## Final note

If you’re here because you struggled with your own portfolio — you’re not alone.

This repo exists because of that struggle.

Take what’s useful. Leave what isn’t.
